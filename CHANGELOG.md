# Changelog

All notable changes to VoiceAgent are documented here. Dates in YYYY-MM-DD.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-24

**Install multiple voices at once, watch each one's progress in the list, and
keep your scroll position while they finish.**

### Added
- **Parallel model installs.** Start up to three downloads simultaneously from
  the Voice Models dialog. Each row shows its own thin progress bar; only the
  currently-downloading row's Install button disables. Other rows stay clickable
  so you can queue more work without waiting.
- **Sticky-to-bottom conversation view.** If you're at the bottom when a new
  turn arrives, the view follows; if you've scrolled up to read history, the
  view stays put and a small "↓" button appears to jump back.
- **Smooth pixel-based wheel scrolling** in both the conversation and the
  Voice Models lists — wheel / trackpad input drives `contentY` directly
  with bounds-checking, replacing the prior page-jump behavior. (True
  inertial coast-and-decelerate remains future work.)
- **Microphone button shows live status** inside the button itself — "Ready —
  tap to talk", "Listening…", "Transcribing…", "Thinking…", etc. The status
  replaces the old separate indicator text.
- **Single-instance guard.** Launching VoiceAgent while it's already running
  raises the existing window instead of spawning a second process.
- **QML runtime logs routed to the Python log file** for easier debugging.

### Changed
- **Conversation model migrated to `QAbstractListModel`.** New turns append in
  place without rebuilding the full list, so the view no longer flashes or
  snaps to the top on every message.
- **Catalog models migrated to `QAbstractListModel`.** When an install/delete
  completes, only the affected row updates — the list doesn't scroll back to
  the top.
- **Catalog rows are non-interactive** except for the Install/Remove and
  Use/Current buttons. No more misleading hover highlight that looked like
  selection cycling during fast scroll.
- **Assistant pipeline status** (Thinking, Transcribing, Playing, etc.) moved
  to the microphone status label. Assistant bubbles only appear once the
  response is final, and they land chronologically below the in-flight status
  events.
- **Default LM Studio timeout** raised from 5 s to 10 s so short reasoning-model
  turns don't cut off.
- **Empty Whisper transcripts** (partial-transcription pass on silence) log at
  INFO instead of WARNING, killing the stdout flood during idle listening.

### Fixed
- **aria2c lifecycle.** `--enable-rpc` made aria2c a daemon that never exited
  on its own, so completed downloads spun the polling loop forever. Now we
  send `aria2.shutdown` RPC on completion, with a 5-second grace period and
  a terminate/kill cascade if the RPC silently fails.
- **aria2 port race under parallel installs.** The reserve-port-then-spawn
  sequence is now serialized with a `threading.Lock` held until aria2c has
  actually bound its RPC port, preventing two workers from being handed the
  same ephemeral port.
- **Stuck-loading regression.** After a download completed, the loader's
  single `_loading` bool could get stuck True, disabling every Install button.
  Replaced with a per-model `_active_items` set so completion of one download
  doesn't touch other rows' state.
- **Download progress storms** no longer invalidate the catalog list.
  Progress ticks emit on a dedicated signal that doesn't notify the model
  list, so the UI stays stable under a running download.
- **Conversation list flicker** during live partial transcription (cause was
  per-tick QVariantList replacement resetting `contentY`).
- **Launch freeze with LM Studio unreachable.** LLM refresh is deferred off
  first-paint via `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` and runs in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`
  so a blocking `urlopen` can't stall the UI thread.
- **PKGBUILD version drift.** The install-path version now matches
  `pyproject.toml` so `makepkg` produces a package with the right semver.
- **SingleInstance cleanup.** `SingleInstance.release()` is wired to
  `QApplication.aboutToQuit` so the lock file and QLocalServer are torn down
  deterministically on graceful shutdown.

### Known follow-ups

See `FOLLOWUPS.md` on the `review-followups` branch for deferred review
findings: thread-safety of per-model progress state, PKGBUILD / PKGBUILD.aur
drift, Python-version-hardcoded launcher, and a set of structural refactors
(loader deduplication, `MicButton.qml` extraction, god-object split).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-02

First Kirigami/QML release. Baseline STT (Whisper) + TTS (Piper) + LM Studio
pipeline, session-setup pane, per-turn conversation bubbles, model manager
dialog.
